Great question! To update your volunteer scheduler project to use a different form platform like Tally, here’s a practical approach you can follow:

How to Integrate Tally Form into Your Workflow
1. Create your form on Tally
Design the volunteer submission form in Tally with fields for:

Full Name

Phone Number

Shifts (date/time/role)

Notify via SMS (Yes/No)

In Tally’s Integrations settings, enable a Webhook to send form submissions to a URL you control (like your backend or an API gateway).

2. Set up a receiving endpoint for form submissions
You’ll need a web endpoint to receive and process Tally’s webhook POST requests.

For example, you could create a simple Flask or FastAPI app, or a serverless function, that:

Receives the JSON payload from Tally

Extracts volunteer info (name, phone, shifts, notify SMS)

Runs your existing Python logic to append to volunteer_input.yaml and trigger SMS notifications

3. Adapt your parsing code
Your current process_submission.py expects an "issue body" in a specific text format.

For Tally, you'll get JSON structured data, so you should:

Write a new parser function that extracts the form fields from Tally’s webhook payload.

Transform these into the internal format your app expects (like the dict with name, phone, shifts, notify_sms).

You can reuse parse_shifts() as long as you convert the shift info correctly.

4. Automate updates
Once the backend receives and processes the form submission:

It can update volunteer_input.yaml and docs/volunteer_schedule.json.

Optionally, trigger SMS notifications immediately.

Or, commit changes back to your GitHub repo via GitHub API or git commands if you want to keep history and version control.

5. Update GitHub workflows
Your GitHub Actions that currently listen to issues events will no longer trigger for Tally forms.

Instead, you can either:

Trigger workflows manually after your backend updates the repo.

Or set up your backend to call GitHub APIs for commits.

Or create a workflow triggered by repository dispatch events or on push to main to send reminders, etc.

Summary of steps to add Tally:
Step	Description	Notes
1. Build Tally form	Design form with required fields	Use Tally’s interface
2. Set up webhook	Web endpoint to receive POST requests	Flask/FastAPI or serverless
3. Parse Tally data	Adapt submission parsing to Tally JSON payload	Convert into existing format
4. Update data files	Append volunteer info to your YAML & JSON files	Trigger SMS notification
5. Adjust workflows	Modify GitHub Actions or replace triggers	For new data submission flow

Example: Minimal Flask webhook receiver
python
Copy
Edit
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import subprocess

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/tally-webhook', methods=['POST'])
def tally_webhook():
    data = request.json
    # Extract info from Tally payload (example keys — check actual payload)
    name = data['answers']['full_name']
    phone = data['answers']['phone_number']
    notify_sms = data['answers']['notify_sms'].lower() == 'yes'

    shifts_raw = data['answers']['shifts']  # Adjust this based on your Tally form design

    # Convert shifts_raw to your format (list of strings)
    # Then run your process_submission.py logic:
    command = [
        'python', 'process_submission.py',
        '--name', name,
        '--phone', phone,
        '--notify-sms',
        '--shifts', *shifts_raw
    ]
    subprocess.run(command, check=True)
    
    return jsonify({"status": "success"}), 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8000)
You’d deploy this somewhere reachable (e.g., AWS Lambda, Heroku, or your own server) and set the webhook URL in Tally to point to https://yourserver.com/tally-webhook.

Final tips
Test carefully with sample Tally submissions.

Log received data to debug.

Keep your secrets (API keys) secure in your backend environment.

If your backend updates the YAML files in GitHub repo, use a GitHub PAT token with permissions to commit changes.

If you want, I can help you write the full new parser or the webhook service code! Just ask.



You said:
is it possible to use a serverless function via severless framework account

ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Using a serverless function with the Serverless Framework is a great approach to handle Tally form webhooks — it’s scalable, cost-effective, and easy to deploy.

How to Use Serverless Framework for Tally Webhook
1. Set up your Serverless Framework project
If you haven’t already, install Serverless CLI:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install -g serverless
Create a new service/project:

bash
Copy
Edit
serverless create --template aws-python3 --path tally-webhook
cd tally-webhook
2. Write your webhook handler
Create a handler.py with a function to process the webhook:

python
Copy
Edit
import json
import subprocess

def webhook(event, context):
    try:
        # Parse incoming request body (Tally sends JSON)
        body = json.loads(event['body'])

        # Extract fields (adjust keys based on your Tally form)
        name = body['answers']['full_name']
        phone = body['answers']['phone_number']
        notify_sms = body['answers']['notify_sms'].lower() == 'yes'
        shifts = body['answers']['shifts']  # Adapt as needed

        # Here you can:
        # 1. Call your existing Python logic as a subprocess
        # 2. Or integrate the logic directly here

        # Example: subprocess call to your process_submission.py script
        # Warning: AWS Lambda has limited filesystem; this is just conceptual
        # command = [
        #     'python', 'process_submission.py',
        #     '--name', name,
        #     '--phone', phone,
        #     '--notify-sms',
        #     '--shifts', *shifts
        # ]
        # subprocess.run(command, check=True)

        # Alternatively: handle parsing and updating files with AWS services (S3, DynamoDB) or GitHub API here

        return {
            "statusCode": 200,
            "body": json.dumps({"message": "Webhook processed successfully"})
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            "statusCode": 500,
            "body": json.dumps({"error": str(e)})
        }
3. Configure serverless.yml
Your serverless.yml should define the function and HTTP event trigger:

yaml
Copy
Edit
service: tally-webhook

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: python3.11
  region: us-east-1  # adjust as needed

functions:
  webhook:
    handler: handler.webhook
    events:
      - http:
          path: tally-webhook
          method: post
          cors: true
4. Deploy the function
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
serverless deploy
This will output the public HTTPS URL where your webhook endpoint is live, e.g.:

bash
Copy
Edit
https://abc123.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/tally-webhook
Set this URL in your Tally form webhook integration.

How to connect with your existing project
In a serverless function, you cannot directly run local Python scripts that update files on your machine or repo.

Instead, you might:

Have the function write new submissions to a database (like DynamoDB).

Trigger another workflow (GitHub Actions, etc.) to sync data and send SMS.

Or use GitHub API from the function to update volunteer_input.yaml in your repo.

Send SMS directly from the function using ClickSend’s API with your stored secrets.

Summary
Benefit	Notes
Serverless + Serverless Framework	Easy deployment & scaling, minimal ops
Webhook URL managed by AWS API Gateway	Public HTTPS URL for Tally webhook
Integrate SMS sending inside function	Call ClickSend API from Lambda directly
GitHub repo updates	Use GitHub API to update repo from Lambda

If you want, I can help you write a full serverless function that:

Parses Tally form submissions,

Sends SMS via ClickSend,

And optionally commits updates to your GitHub repo.

Would you like me to draft that?
